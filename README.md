SMTP-Mail-Client
===================
By the end of this lab, you will have acquired a better understanding of SMTP protocol. You will also gain experience in implementing a standard protocol using Python. Your task is to develop a simple mail client that sends email to any recipient. Your client will need to connect to a mail server, dialogue with the mail server using the SMTP protocol, and send an email message to the mail server. Python provides a module, called smtplib, which has built in methods to send mail using SMTP protocol. However, we will not be using this module in this lab, because it hide the details of SMTP and socket programming. In order to limit spam, some mail servers do not accept TCP connection from arbitrary sources. For the experiment described below, you may want to try connecting both to your university mail server and to a popular Webmail server, such as a AOL mail server. You may also try making your connection both from your home and from your university campus.
